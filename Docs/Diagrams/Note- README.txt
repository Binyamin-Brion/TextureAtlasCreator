The diagrams included here show sample parts of the program that were determined to be the most
useful or hardest to understand.

For the class diagrams, the specifics of each class- their member variables and functions- are
not shown. This is because there would be too much content in each diagram, making it hard to
read. Rather, each diagram shows the class, what it inherites, and any references to other
classes. Note that this does not include association, becuase this too would make each
class diagram very large. It was determined that showing only held references to other objects
was sufficient to show the structure of the classes in this program.

For the sequence diagrams, only select parts of the control flow are show (see the diagrams
for what is included). The control flow shown should be enough to understand the general 
execution of the program, and any specifics can be determined from the code. This too ensures
that each diagram is not too large and is readable.
